# Introduction
"*At least someone will teach them how to write the words **assert** and **dump** in their code..."*

## Who Assert Is For
Assert is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons.
The community *consisting of me* is very hospitable and happy to answer any questions.
Hundreds of companies, large and small, **don't** use Assert in production.
