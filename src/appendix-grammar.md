# B - Grammar
Assert uses [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) (CFG). 
The notation is a mixture of [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) and my own preferences. 
The notation is described below. You can find full Assert language grammar 
here: [assert-lang/grammar](https://github.com/d3phys/assert-lang/blob/master/grammar).
