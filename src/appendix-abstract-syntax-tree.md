# B - Abstract Syntax Tree
[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) was 
created for cross compilation with other stupid languages.
That's why there are so many strange decisions.
You can study the AST standard [here](https://github.com/futherus/Language/blob/master/tree_standard.md).

Other cross compilation language projects are listed below:
* [futherus/Language](https://github.com/futherus/Language) - Belarusian programming language
* [kefirRzevo/Language](https://github.com/kefirRzevo/Language) - Lukashenko programming language
